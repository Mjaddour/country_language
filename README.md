# AI Chat Assistant with Audio Playback

This project is an AI-powered chatbot built with **Gradio** and **OpenAI**, featuring text-based responses and optional audio playback for the assistant's messages.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Chat:** Users can chat with an AI assistant to ask questions, get responses, or perform tasks.
- **Audio Playback:** A "Play Last Response" button allows users to hear the assistant's most recent response via text-to-speech.
- **Dynamic Image Output:** The assistant can optionally provide image outputs based on the conversation context.
- **Clear Chat History:** Users can clear the chat to start a new conversation.

1. **Python 3.7+**
2. **Dependencies:**
   - `gradio`
   - `openai`
   - `pydub`
   - `ffmpeg` (required for audio playback)
3. **OpenAI API Key:** For accessing OpenAI's models.
4. **ffplay:** A tool from `ffmpeg` for audio playback.

## File Structure

```plaintext
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                  # Main application file
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md               # Project documentation
â””â”€â”€ .env                    # OpenAI API Key (not included in the repo)
```

## How It Works

### Key Components:
1. **Chat Functionality:**
   - Handles user inputs and generates responses using OpenAI's models.
   - Adds the assistant's responses to the conversation history.

2. **Audio Playback:**
   - Converts the assistant's text responses to audio using OpenAI's text-to-speech API.
   - Plays the audio using the `ffplay` tool.

3. **Gradio Interface:**
   - Provides an interactive user interface with a chatbot, image output, and control buttons.

### Workflow:
1. User enters a message in the chatbox.
2. The chatbot processes the message and generates a response.
3. The response is displayed, and the user can optionally play the response audio.
